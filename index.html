        <h2>About Gare:</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Gare. I'm originally from Atlanta, GA. In Texas, 
          I was the Housekeeping Manager for multiple hotels for 4 years. 
          During my tenure with our company, of which I no longer work for, I directly managed and trained several teams of housekeepers on a single, reliable, and consistent set of cleaning standard of which I would alongside the teams I managed. 
          The Hotel Brands I have worked with in the past include IHG Hotels & Resorts, Choice Hotels, as well Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. I am presently unaffiliated with any of the aforementioned brands. 
          I am not currently affiliated with any Hospitality-based Companies, nor any Airbnb listings.  I maintain these skills and now offer them as a Professional Services to new clients in the Las Vegas, Nevada area.
          I am a Professional, but also understanding. If you may find difficulty in paying within the stated price range for a service: consider my Low-Budget or Single Area alternatives, and please be up front with what you are able to pay should such a service price needbe negotiated.</p>
